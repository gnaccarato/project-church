            <p style="text-align: center;">"Let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. Although man can forget God or reject him, He never ceases to call every man to seek him, so as to find life and happiness. But this search for God demands of man every effort of intellect, a sound will, an upright heart, as well as the witness of others who teach him to seek God."<br>

            <p>St. Alphonsus Parish Toronto is a Catholic Christian congregation serving the Toronto community and seeking, engaging, and encouraging others through a life-changing Christian journey.St. Alphonsus Parish in Toronto, Ontario seeks to be a loving, friendly community that worships God, and serves others. We place a high priority on teaching from the Bible and following the example of Jesus. Our vision is to impact and renew Toronto, Ontario and beyond with the transforming message of Jesus Christ through words and actions. Everyone is welcome.

            </p><br>

            <p>Since its foundation in 1966, the Carmelite Sisters of St. Terese of the Child Jesus established a Day Care for children and youth. They continue to serve the parish in that ministry as well as being of service in other ministries of the parish.
            </p><br>

            <p>In 1968 the Missionaries of the Precious Blood, (C.PP.S.)  of the Atlantic Province began their ministry in the parish and continue to serve the parish in sacramental and administrative roles. They formed daily adoration of the Blessed Sacrament (Monday through Friday) beginning after the morning mass and continues until the evening mass. Evening Prayer from the Liturgy of the Hours is also prayed before the evening mass. Since its beginning the Missionaries have instilled a sense of "being missionary" in this community. This continues through works in the Mission Office, presently headquartered in the building.
